And so, I'm just going to back up a tiny bit and start over to get our heads into it, and then fairly
quickly move on to new things.

*** Probabilities can never be more than 1 as we'll see.

>> let's now try and think of the right way to look at this question.

Q: How many possible 10-digit numbers are there?
A: 6^10 (6 to the 10th)

Q: What's the odds[ädz] of not getting 1 the first or the second time?
A: 5/6 * 5/6 (5 over 6 times 5 over 6) because these are independent events.(that's a key notion here)

notion: a conception of or belief about something.

>> I'm assuming that whether I get a 1 on the second roll is independent of whether I got a 1 on the first
roll.

dice die: throwing the dice
et cetera[et ˈsedərə]

The probability of not getting a 1 in 10 rolls : (5/6)^10 ((5 over 6) to the 10th)

>> That make sense?
>> If not, speak up, because things are going to get more complicated quickly.

Q: Are you all with me on that?

>> It was good effort.

** If you want to get something where everything is covered, the probabilities always have to sum to 1.
There are only two possibilities here, one possibility is I don't get any 1's. One possibility is I get
at least one 1.

If I take all of the possibilities, and I subtract the possibilities of not getting any 1's, the result
must be the probability of getting at least one 1.

>> This is a very common trick in sth(computing probabilities).

Q: What's the probability of x ?
A: The simplest way to compute it, is to compute the probability of not x and subtract it from 1.

>> heading down a wrong track for this, one might have said, .....

>> we know that can't be true. Because a probability always has to be less than or equal to 1.
This is a good trick to keep in mind, whenever you've given a probability problem, try and figure out
whether you have a good way to compute it directly, or whether it's simpler to compute the not of the
probability, and then subtract it from 1.

Probability is really fun field. It's interesting, it's history, it's intimately[ˈin(t)əmətlē] connected

Q: Is it profitable to do sth(to bet that given 24 rolls of a pair of fair dice, you would roll a double 6?

profitable: (of a business or activity) yielding profit or financial gain.
{Yield[yēld]: 1. produce or provide (a natural, agricultural[ˌaɡrəˈkəlCH(ə)rəl], or industrial product).
2.give way to arguments, demands, or pressure.}

Situation: He (actually) had a friend (who was in the business of gambling), making these bets[bet].

>> Double 6, what we call today "box cars", in those days they just called two 6's.
>> This was considered a (really) hard problem (in the mid-17th century).
>> In fact, Pascal and Fermat, (two pretty smart guys) as it happens, debated[dəˈbāt] this.
They exchanged sth(letter) with each other doing sth(trying to figure out)(how to solve this problem.)
>> It shows sth.(how math has advanced), because, in fact, today, it's quite an easy problem.

Q: What's the probability of not getting it 24 times(not getting a double 6) in a row?
A: (35/36)^24, which is approximately[əˈpräksəmətlē] equal to 0.51.

There is a slight edge in betting that you will not get a double 6 in 24 times.

>> As old as dice is, people have built cheater's dice.
The excavation of Pompeii, for example, they discovered a pair of loaded dice, dice with a little weight in it so
one number would come up more often that it should.

That's the, well, to 17 digits of precision, the exact answer.

>> came up with: to bring forth, discover, or produce.
And you can see we came up with something close to that. Not exactly that, and we wouldn't expect to.

Q: how do we know how many trials to run?

>> The interesting thing is ...(I'm sure it took me less time to write this program than it took Pascal
to solve the problem.)
>> took sb less time to do sth than to do others.
The truth is, I have several hundred years of people's work to build on.
** several hundred years.

Q: Is it easier sometimes to do sth(write a simulation), than ...(it is to do the probabilities?)
A: What I often do in practice is both.

>> I'll scratch[skraCH] my head and figure out how to figure out(come up with) the answer {analytically:
adv. using analysis or logical reasoning.}. and then if it's easy, I'll write some code to simulate the problem
, and expect to get roughly the same answer, giving me confidence I've done it correctly.

** coined: to invent a new word or expression
The term was coined in 1949 by Stanislaw Ulam and Nicholas Metropolis, (two very well-known mathematicians)
Ulam, who later become famous for designing the hydrogen[ˈhīdrəjən] bomb with Teller, invented the method in
1946, and I'm going to quote from his description of how he invented it.

>> "The first thoughts and attempts I made to practice the Monte Carlo method, were suggested by a question
which occurred to me in 1946, as I was {convalescing[ˌkänvəˈles]: recover one's health or strength over a
period of time after an illness or operation"} from an illness and playing {solitaires[ˈsäləˌter]: any of various
card games played by one person}

>> "The question was, what are the chances that a canfield solitaire laid out with 52 cards will come out
successfully? After spending a lot of time doing sth(trying to estimate them )by pure combinatorial[ˌkämb(ə)nəˈtôrēəl]"
calculations I wondered whether a more practical method than (quote) 'abstract{existing in thought} think' (end quote),
might not be to lay it out, say 100 times, and simply observe and count the number of successful plays."

envision[ənˈviZHən]: verb. imagine as a future possibility; visualize.

>> This was already possible to do(envision) with sth(the beginning of the new area of fast computers.
And I immediately thought of problems, as you would, immediately thought of problems of neutron {diffusion
[dəˈfyo͞oZHən]: the spreading of sth move widely} and other questions of mathematical physics.
And more generally, how to change processes described by certain differential equations into an equivalent
[əˈkwiv(ə)lənt] form interpretable[inˈtərprət] as a succession of random operations.

interpret[inˈtərprət]: verb. explain the meaning of (information, words, or actions).

succession[səkˈseSHən]:the action or process of inheriting a title, office, property, etc.;
the new king was already {elderly[ˈeldərlē]:(of a person) old or aging.} at the time of his succession.

>> As early as 1946 (the year), people were thinking about the question of moving away from solving systems
of equations to using randomized techniques to simulate things and try to find out what the actual answer
was that way.

** "Fast" is a relative term.
Ulam was probably doing(referring) to the ENIAC computer, which could perform about 10 to the 3 additions
a second.(1000 operations a second), and weighted approximately 25 tons. Now today's computers, by comparison,
perform 10 to the 9th additions and weight about 10 to the minus 3 tons.

>> This technique was used (during the Manhattan Project) to predict what would happen doing (during nuclear
fission and worked.)

fission[ˈfiSHən]: the action of dividing or splitting something into two or more parts.

>> (Monte Carlo simulations) are an example of what's called "inferential statistics"

** inferential [ˌinfəˈren(t)SH(ə)l]: 推论

Inferential statistics is based upon one guiding principle. And that principle is that a random sample
tends to {exhibit[iɡˈzibət]: manifest[ˈmanəˌfest]: clear or obvious to the eye or mind.} the same properties
as the population from which it is drawn.

>> explain to the above, if I try and sample people for predicting an election, the notion is if I go and I
asked a 1,000 people at random in Massachusetts who they're going to vote for, the average will be about the same
as if I looked at the whole population.

>> whenever we use a statistical method like this,
Q: is those 100,000 times I threw the pair of dice, that would be representative of all possible throws of the
dice, the infinite number of possible throws?
A: Yes, due to show upon the inferential statistics.

>> One always has to ask the question ...(whether this is true or whether one has a sampling technique that is,
for example, giving you a biased sample.

** biased [ˈbīəst]: unfairly {prejudiced}[ˈprejədəst]: having or showing a dislike or distrust that is derived[dəˈrīv]
from prejudice}  for or against someone or something.

Little later in the term, we'll talk about many ways in which you can get fooled here and think you're doing a
fair statistical analysis, and get all the math right, and still come up with the wrong answer because this
assumption doesn't actually hold.

Now in term of coins, a little sample than dice, where (you can flip a coin and you get either a head or a tail).

Q: Would you feel good inferring from that the next time he flipped a coin it would also come up heads?

>> I would infer that the coin was two-headed.
>> Your common sense tells sb sth.

>> This is technically called comparing something to the null hypothesis[ hīˈpäTHəsəs].
null hypothesis: (in a statistical test) the hypothesis that there is no significant difference between specified
populations, any observed difference being due to sampling or experimental error.
The null hypothesis is what you would get with a random event.


** This is an example of what's called "the law of large numbers", also known as Bernoulli's Law, after one of
the Bernoulli family of mathematicians, and I can't, for the life of me, remember which Bernoulli.

>> There are a whole bunch of them.

underlie: be a significant cause or basis of (something) even if not necessarily manifest or obvious.

**Anyway the law states, and it's important to understand this because again it underlies the inferential
statistics, that in repeated independent teats, and it's important to note the word "independent", each test
has to be independent of the earlier test.

e.g. In this case, the tests are filps of the coin with the same actual probability we'll call it p, often used
to represent probability, of an outcome for each test, the chance that the fraction of times outcome occurs
{converges[kənˈvərj]: (of lines) tend to meet at a point.} to P as number of trails goes to infinity.


>> It's worth noting that this law does not imply[imˈplī] that if start out with deviations from the expected
behaviors, those deviations are likely to be quote "evened out" by opposite[ˈäpəzət] deviations in the future.

So if I happen to start by getting a whole bunch of heads in a row, it does not mean that I'm more likely to get
tails in a {subsequent[ˈsəbsəkwənt]: coming after something in time; following.} trail.

>> Because if that were true, then they wouldn't be independent.
** Independent means memoryless

*** If I have an independent process, what happens in the future cannot be affected by the past.
And therefore, I don't get this business of "they even out".

even out: to become equal, or to make something equal:

>> Now people refuse to believe this.
If you go to any gambling place you'll discover that if people threw the roulette[ro͞oˈlet] wheel[(h)wēl], if
black comes up 20 times in a row, they'll be a rush bet on read. "Red is do"

You'll notice that it appears (that maybe I'm biasing a little bit), because I'm giving 0.5 a value.
But there are so many floating point numbers between 0 and 1. That the probability of getting exactly 0.5 is
so small that I can ignore it.

>> we also saw something where it went up a little bit then it went down and then shot up dramatically at the end,
