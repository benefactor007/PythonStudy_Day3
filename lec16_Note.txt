>> sb(He) ended up date(last Thursday's) lectures (talking about Gaussian distributions).

As he said, one of the interesting things(plural) about a Gaussian is it can be fully characterized
by its mean and its standard deviation.

characterized[ˈkerəktəˌrīz]: describe the distinctive nature or features of.

>>> sth of being able to
>>> ... will continue to do as a very important way of doing sth
>> And this concept of being able to take a curve and characterize it with a small number of parameters is something
we'll continue to see as a very important way of looking at modeling physical systems.


>> the part of the term that...
And in fact, that is the part of the term that we've entered.
It's a part of the term we'll spend a lot of time on it.

>> The whole issue is, how we construct computational models that will help us understand the real world?

When we can, we love to model distributions as Gaussian's normal, because they're so nicely characterized.

We have nice rules of thumb that tell us how close things lie to the mean, et certera.

heuristic[hyo͞oˈristik]: enabling someone to discover or learn something for themselves.
guideline[ˈɡīdˌlīn]
** A rule of thumb is a heuristic guideline that provides simplified advice or some basic rule-set regarding
a particular subject or course of action.

>> However, it's important to understand that if something is not actually normally distributed and we pretend it is,
we can get very misleading results out of our model.

Let's think about the fact that not all(negatives) distribution are normal.

So consider rolling a single die.
>> Each of the 6 outcomes is equally probable.
we would not expect to see a peak as 3 or 4, and a trough[trôf] at 1. A 3 or a 4 is the same probability as 1
>> ... be the same sth(noun.) as ....
trough[trôf]: 食槽, a long, narrow open container for animals to eat or drink out of.

>> Similarly....
if one thinks about the Massachusetts state lottery, or any fair lottery,
>> each number coming up
** The probability of each number coming up is the same.
So it would be a flat[flat] line.
flat[flat]: smooth and even; without marked lumps or indentations.
lump[ləmp]: 块
indentation[ˌindenˈtāSH(ə)n]: 缩进; a deep recess[ˈrēˌses] or notch[näCH] on the edge or surface of something.

> If you had a million numbers(plural), the probability of each number is 1 over a million.(1/1,000,000)
> And so if you plotted the probability of each number again, you'd get a flat line.
**>> Such distributions are called uniform because each result(singular) is equally probable.

We can fully characterize a uniform distribution with a single parameter, its range.
If I tell you it ranges over 1 to a million, that's all you need to know what the distribution looks like.
** A uniform distribution is the one in which all the values are equally possible within a given range.
>> They're even simpler than normal distributions. Uniform distributions occur quite often in games devised by humans,
but almost never in nature.
>> ..sth.. occur quite often in ..[some field].., but almost never in ..[some field]..
devise[dəˈvīz]: plan or invent (a complex procedure[prəˈsējər], system, or mechanism) by careful thought.
procedure[prəˈsējər]: an established or official way of doing something.

>> Typically they're not very useful for modeling complex systems.
>> ..(we).. have to work hard to do sth.
e.g. we have to work hard to invent things that are uniform.
** Most things are not naturally that way.
>> as we do ..[time]..
Normally, as we saw last time, occurs all the time in nature.
The other thing that occurs quite frequently are exponential distributions.

>> ... be used in ...
>> They're used in a lot of different ways.
For example, people who are trying to plan things like highway systems use exponential distributions to model
inter-arrival times, how much time there is between each car(singular) entering the Mass Turnpike.
We'll see many other examples of them.

>> The key thing about them is...
... they have the property of being memoryless.

>> The property of being [adjective]
They are in fact the only continuous distributions that are memoryless.

Let's look at an example with which some of you are more familiar than you want to be, the concentration of
a drug in the human body

concentration: 浓度, the relative amount of a given substance contained within a solution or in a particular volume of
space; the amount of solute[ˈsälyo͞ot] per unit volume of solution.
solute[ˈsälyo͞ot]: 溶质, he minor component in a solution, dissolved in the solvent.
solvent[ˈsälvənt]: 溶剂, the liquid in which a solute is dissolved to form a solution.

>> For those who are watching on ....
>> It's not because.... It's because....
e.g. It's not because all the students are drug users. It's because they're working on a problem set that involves
modeling drugs in the human body.

I don't know how many of you are drug users, all right?
Assume that at each time step(singular), each molecule[ˈmäləˌkyo͞ol] has a probability p of being cleared by the body.
The system is memoryless in the sense that at each step, the probability of (a particular molecule being cleared) is
independent of what happened at the previous steps. So the fact that a molecule didn't get cleared at time(t) has no
impact on whether or not it will be cleared at time, t1.

The probability doesn't go up as it doesn't get cleared. So it's independent of the previous steps.

>> ..sth.. still being in ..[some place]..
Q: At time t equals 1, what's the probability of the molecule still being in the human body?
A: If the probability of being cleared at each step is p, (the answer)it's 1 minus p.(1-p)
> if the probability of being cleared was 0.5 at each time step, the time that it still exists after the first time step
  is 1 minus 0.5. i.e., 0.5

*** i.e. means that is

Q: What's the probability of it still being in the human boday at time t equals 2?
It wasn't cleared at time 1, since it's memoryless(independent), whether or not it's cleared at times 2, is also 1/p.
so it's existing still after two steps is going to be (1-p)**0.5, 1 minus p squared.
We saw that with independent probabilities. And the nice thing about working with exponential distributions is we know that
the probabilities are independent.
exponential[ˌekspəˈnen(t)SH(ə)l]

>> More generally, it's still being in the body at time t is going to be (1-p)^t, 1 minus p to the t.
So now we have a nice closed-form solution (that will give us the probability of each molecule surviving until time t).

>> ... give(s) sb(us) sth...

Let's look at the question of, suppose that at time t=0 (t equals 0), there are m0 molecules.

>> ... be(is) likely to be at ..[time]..
Q: Now we can ask, how many molecules are there likely to be at any time t?
A: Let's write a little program to look at that.

struggle[ˈstrəɡəl]
phrase[frāz]

{decay[dəˈkā]:to decrease usually gradually in size, quantity, activity, or force}.
gradually[ˈɡrajo͞oəlē]: in a gradual way; slowly; by degrees.

>> it never gets there ....
> exponential decay. It drops very quickly in the beginning, and then it asymptotes towards 0. But of course
  it never quite gets there in a continuous model.
> If we had a discrete model, we would eventually have to get to 0, because that last molecule would either
  get cleared or not.
> But in a continuous world, which is in this case, probably not a good model, or not a perfect model I should say,
  because it allows us to have a quarter of a molecule there, which we kind of know is physiologically nonsense,
  biochemically nonsense.

asymptote[ˈasəm(p)ˌtōt]: noun. a line that continually approaches a given curve but does not meet it at any finite
                         distance.
physioloically[ˌfizēəˈläjək(ə)lē]: in a way that relates to the functions of living organisms[ˈôrɡəˌnizəm] and
                                   their parts.
organism[ˈôrɡəˌnizəm]: an individual animal, plant, or single-celled[sel] life form.

You can see we get this exponential decay.
>> But as we saw previously, if we plot an exponential on a log axis, as the math would tell us, we get a straight line.

And that, in fact, is a very simple and nice way to see whether you have an exponential distribution.
>>> Put it on a log axis, see if it's straight.

It's a good trick, and one we use a lot.
So there, I look the physical model I described and derived through a little bit of math, what the result
should be, and implemented some code to give us a plot of what that told us.

derive[dəˈrīv]: obtain something from (a specified source).

>> Let's look at a different way of doing it.
I could have instead written a Monte Carlo simulation to do the same kind of thing.
> So here, instead of working out the probabilities, I just tried to write some code that exactly mimicked the
  physical process that I was talking about.
> So instead of knowing that I could just look at 1 minus p to the t, at each step, I cleared some molecules.

mimic[ˈmimik]: imitate (someone or their actions or words), especially in order to entertain or ridicule.
imitate[ˈiməˌtāt]: take or follow as a model.

>> I did that for each molecule, deciding whether or not it should be cleared.

> Let's look what happens if compare the two results.

Add on Friday afternoon, Dec. 31.
>> Well, much to my relief, I get kind of the same curve.
> Not exactly. You'll notice that the blue curve, the analytical[ˌanəˈlidik(ə)l] model is a beautiful smooth
  curve, whereas the red curve has got a little bit of jaggies.

relief[rəˈlēf]: a feeling of reassurance and relaxation following release from anxiety[aNGˈzīədē] or distress[dəˈstres].
reassurance[ˌrēəˈSHo͝orəns]: the action of removing someone's doubts or fears.
whereas: in contrast or comparison with the fact that.
jaggies[ˈjaɡəd]: having rough, sharp points protruding[prəˈtro͞odiNG].
protruding[prəˈtro͞odiNG]: sticking out; projecting.

> It's clearly very similar to the blue curve, but not identical.
identical: similar in every detail; exactly alike.
>> It doesn't surprise me.

There is some randomness in there. And in fact, I could have gotten unlucky and gotten something that didn't
look like the blue curve. But given the sample size, that would have been quite surprising.

>> Which of ....
Q: Which of these two models do you like better?
We've got one I'll call the analytical model, and one I'll call the simulation model.
> Both sho exponential decay[dəˈkā].
>> That is to
> That is to say the number of molecules declines exponentially, quite quickly.
But they're not quite identical.
Q: Which would we prefer or which would you prefer?
A: There is no right answer for this.
>> There is + no + (adjective) + (singular noun)
Just for fun, I'll ask for a poll.
Q: Who prefers the analytical model?
Q: Who prefer the simulation?

Somebody who prefers(Third-Person singular verb) the analytical, tell me why.
> It looks a lot nicer. That's kind of human nature, to prefer something that looks prettier.
On the other hand, (what we're really interested in) is the question of not aesthetics[esˈTHediks],
but fidelity to the actual physical situation

aesthetics[esˈTHediks]: a set of principles concerned with the nature and appreciation of beauty,
                        especially in art.
fidelity[fəˈdelədē]: faithfulness to a person, cause, or belief, demonstrated by continuing loyalty
                      and support.

A straight line might look even nicer, but it wouldn't be accurate.
So when we think about evaluating a model, what we really should be asking, I think, are two questions.
** One is fidelity
** And another way to think about that is credibility.

Add on Wednesday night, Jan. 5.

> Typically, we're creating a model because we don't know the actual answer.
>> ... be trying to do sth(what happen)
And we're trying to see what might actually happen if we, say, ran a physical experiment.
>> we have to ask the question of, .......
And so we have to ask the question of, do we believe the results (that) the model are giving us.
>>>

    boil down:  to reduce in bulk[bəlk]{the mass or magnitude of something large.} by boiling; condense, summarize
                e.g. boil down the report.
    condense:   make (something) denser or more concentrated.
                e.g. The limestones of the Jurassic[jəˈrasik] age are condensed into a mere 11 feet.
    mere[mir]:   that is solely or no more or better than what is specified.
    solely[ˈsō(l)lē]:   not involving anyone or anything else; only
    anyone else:    any other person
                    e.g. she arrived 10 minutes before anyone else.

>>> So that sort of boils down to not a question of mathematics, but a question of reasoning.
    Can we look at the model and convince ourselves that it is accurate?

    convince:   cause (someone) to believe firmly in the truth of something.

*** The other question is utility.
    utility:    the state of being useful, profitable, or beneficial.

>>> I can think about that as in some sense, what questions are answerable with the model?
    >>> .... be answerable with sth...
    The first one is pretty much a question of personal preference.
    And for this particular simulation, which is pretty simple, or this particular model, it's hard to argue that
    one is more believable than the other.
    I might argue the second is more believable, because it's a direct implementation of the physical system.
    I didn't rely on my math being right. But the math is pretty simple here.
    >>> .... rely on sth being right ....


*** What is more apparent is in this case there is some additional utility offered by the simulation model.
    >>> apparent: adjective. clear or manifest to the understanding
    >>> manifest[ˈmanəˌfest]: adjective. able to be seen : clearly shown or visible;  easy to understand or recognize
                    e.g. Their sadness was manifest in their faces.
                    e.g. The truth was more manifest[=(more commonly) obvious] to everyone but me.
>>> It's often true of that, simulation models, that we can ask what-if questions, because we can easily change the
    model to be slightly different in ways that is usually harder for an analytic model.

    For example, suppose these drug molecules has this peculiar property that every 100 time steps, they could clone
    themselves. And so every molecule that was there became two molecules.
    >>> peculiar[pəˈkyo͞olyər]: adjective, special, particular

    Not so unlikely for, a bacterium or a virus as you've seen.
    >>> bacterium[ˌbakˈtirēəm]: 细菌

    A little hard to figure out how to do the probabilities in the case that happens, because we'll no longer get this
    beautiful simple exponential decay. But quite easy to think about how we would change the simulation model, which is
    what I have done here.
    >>> .... will no longer get sth.

    Every living molecule will clone itself.
    And now we'll see what we get.

>>> Well, we get this rather peculiar-looking sawtooth distribution.
    >>> rather: in some degree : SOMEWHAT
                e.g. it's rather warm
                —often used as a mild intensive[]
                e.g. spent rather a lot of money
        somewhat:   adverb. slightly,
                    e.g.  He felt somewhat awkward in his suit.
                          Our work has progressed somewhat.
                          The course is somewhat more difficult than I was told it would be.
        sawtooth[ˈsôto͞oTH]:   having serrations : arranged or having parts arranged like the teeth of a saw
        serration: noun. a tooth or point of a serrated edge or surface.
    We still have, overall, an exponential decay. But we see every once in while it jumps up, and then it comes down.
    >>> ... do every once in while + object(....)
        It's not so easy to write a simple closed-form formula that describes this. (so the analytics model is not
        applicable), but very easy to produce a simulation model that gives you some insight to what's happening here.
    >>> insight[ˈinˌsīt]:    the ability to understand people and situations in a very clear way
                             e.g. He is a leader of great insight.
    And that's, I think, one of the great attractions of simulation modeling, is we get to do this sort of thing.

>>> Many physical systems exhibit[iɡˈzibət] exponential decay or exponential growth.
    For example, people in Japan now are very interested in half-life of various radioactive[ˌrādēōˈaktiv] particles.
    And when we talk about half-life, we mean that there is exponential decay in radioactivity.
    That's what half-life is.
    So people are looking at what is the half-life of iodine[ˈīəˌdīn], versus other radioactive particles.
    >>> iodine [ˈīəˌdīn]:   碘
    We also see exponential growth a lot.
    I used to have a swimming pool which I had to maintain, and I realized if I let the algae get out of control in the
    pool, it went from having very little algae to having a lot of algae very quickly, because the algae doubles every
    period[ˈpir-ē-əd ]. And so all of a sudden, it takes off.
    >>> alga [ˈalɡə]:   plural: algae
    So exponential growth is exponential decay are important things. ????
    We see them all the time.
    People use the word very carelessly when they mean quick growth. They say exponential. But of course, it has a very
    specific meaning.

>>> We've now, for the moment at least, finished out short venture into probability and distributions.
    >>> ... do finish venture into ....(object)
    We'll come back to it a little bit when we talk about how to lie with statistics.
    But before we do that, before we leave probability for a while, just for fun, I want to pose to you one of these
    probability problems that hurts people's heads.

    It's a very popular one.
    Q: how many people here have heard of the Monty Hall[hôl] problem?
    Monty Hall
    Monty Hall
    Money Hall

    >>> As we play the game, those of you who know the answer, I'll ask you forbearance not to blurt it out.
        >>> forbearance [fôrˈberəns]: patient self-control; restraint and tolerance.
            restraint [rəˈstrānt]:  noun. a measure or condition that keeps someone or something under control or
                                    within limits.
                                    e.g. decisions are made within the financial restraints of the budget.
            tolerance [ˈtäl(ə)rəns]:    the ability or willingness to tolerate something, in particular the existence of
                                        opinions or behavior that one does not necessarily agree with.
                                        e.g. the tolerance of corruption.
            tolerate [ˈtäləˌrāt]:   allow the existence, occurrence, or practice of (something that one does not
                                    necessarily like or agree with) without interference.
            blurt [blərt]: say (something) suddenly and without careful consideration.

    >>> It's a wonderful problem.
        It's so exciting that people have written books about it.
        So here's how it works.
        This is from a game show called, Let's make a deal, with the host, Monty Hall, who did it forever.
        So (the way it works) is you start with three doors. Behind one of the doors is a great prize. e.g. an
        automobile[ˌȯ-tə-mō-ˈbēl ].
        >>> automobile: automotive
        Behind each of the other is a booby prize, typically a goat.
        I don't know why people don't like goats, but apparently they don't.
        So the way it works is Monty invites someone from the audience, chosen on the basis of their outlandish costumes.
        >>> outlandish [outˈlandiSH]:   looking or sounding bizarre[bəˈzär] or unfamiliar.
        >>> costume [ˈkä-ˌstüm]:    a set of clothes in a style typical of a particular country or historical period.
        And they come down and they're told what wonderful prize is behind one of the doors.
        >>> come down:  Literally, to descend[dəˈsend] from a higher point to a lower one
                        to place oneself in opposition
        And then they're asked to choose a door.
        So the person might choose a door and say, I'll choose door number one.
