>> sb ended up date(last Thursday's) lectures (talking about Gaussian distributions).

As he said, one of the interesting things(plural) about a Gaussian is it can be fully characterized
by its mean and its standard deviation.

characterized[ˈkerəktəˌrīz]: describe the distinctive nature or features of.

>>> sth of being able to
>>> ... will continue to do as a very important way of doing sth
>> And this concept of being able to take a curve and characterize it with a small number of parameters is something
we'll continue to see as a very important way of looking at modeling physical systems.


>> the part of the term that...
And in fact, that is the part of the term that we've entered.
It's a part of the term we'll spend a lot of time on it.

>> The whole issue is, how we construct computational models that will help us understand the real world?

When we can, we love to model distributions as Gaussian's normal, because they're so nicely characterized.

We have nice rules of thumb that tell us how close things lie to the mean, et certera.

heuristic[hyo͞oˈristik]: enabling someone to discover or learn something for themselves.
guideline[ˈɡīdˌlīn]
** A rule of thumb is a heuristic guideline that provides simplified advice or some basic rule-set regarding
a particular subject or course of action.

>> However, it's important to understand that if something is not actually normally distributed and we pretend it is,
we can get very misleading results out of our model.

Let's think about the fact that not all(negatives) distribution are normal.

So consider rolling a single die.
>> Each of the 6 outcomes is equally probable.
we would not expect to see a peak as 3 or 4, and a trough[trôf] at 1. A 3 or a 4 is the same probability as 1
>> ... be the same sth(noun.) as ....
trough[trôf]: 食槽, a long, narrow open container for animals to eat or drink out of.

>> Similarly....
if one thinks about the Massachusetts state lottery, or any fair lottery,
>> each number coming up
** The probability of each number coming up is the same.
So it would be a flat[flat] line.
flat[flat]: smooth and even; without marked lumps or indentations.
lump[ləmp]: 块
indentation[ˌindenˈtāSH(ə)n]: 缩进; a deep recess[ˈrēˌses] or notch[näCH] on the edge or surface of something.

> If you had a million numbers(plural), the probability of each number is 1 over a million.(1/1,000,000)
> And so if you plotted the probability of each number again, you'd get a flat line.
**>> Such distributions are called uniform because each result(singular) is equally probable.

We can fully characterize a uniform distribution with a single parameter, its range.
If I tell you it ranges over 1 to a million, that's all you need to know what the distribution looks like.
** A uniform distribution is the one in which all the values are equally possible within a given range.
>> They're even simpler than normal distributions. Uniform distributions occur quite often in games devised by humans,
but almost never in nature.
>> ..sth.. occur quite often in ..[some field].., but almost never in ..[some field]..
devise[dəˈvīz]: plan or invent (a complex procedure[prəˈsējər], system, or mechanism) by careful thought.
procedure[prəˈsējər]: an established or official way of doing something.

>> Typically they're not very useful for modeling complex systems.
>> ..(we).. have to work hard to do sth.
e.g. we have to work hard to invent things that are uniform.
** Most things are not naturally that way.
>> as we do ..[time]..
Normally, as we saw last time, occurs all the time in nature.
The other thing that occurs quite frequently are exponential distributions.

>> ... be used in ...
>> They're used in a lot of different ways.
For example, people who are trying to plan things like highway systems use exponential distributions to model
inter-arrival times, how much time there is between each car(singular) entering the Mass Turnpike.
We'll see many other examples of them.

>> The key thing about them is...
... they have the property of being memoryless.

>> The property of being [adjective]
They are in fact the only continuous distributions that are memoryless.

Let's look at an example with which some of you are more familiar than you want to be, the concentration of
a drug in the human body

concentration: 浓度, the relative amount of a given substance contained within a solution or in a particular volume of
space; the amount of solute[ˈsälyo͞ot] per unit volume of solution.
solute[ˈsälyo͞ot]: 溶质, he minor component in a solution, dissolved in the solvent.
solvent[ˈsälvənt]: 溶剂, the liquid in which a solute is dissolved to form a solution.

>> For those who are watching on ....
>> It's not because.... It's because....
e.g. It's not because all the students are drug users. It's because they're working on a problem set that involves
modeling drugs in the human body.

I don't know how many of you are drug users, all right?
Assume that at each time step(singular), each molecule[ˈmäləˌkyo͞ol] has a probability p of being cleared by the body.
The system is memoryless in the sense that at each step, the probability of (a particular molecule being cleared) is
independent of what happened at the previous steps. So the fact that a molecule didn't get cleared at time(t) has no
impact on whether or not it will be cleared at time, t1.

The probability doesn't go up as it doesn't get cleared. So it's independent of the previous steps.

>> ..sth.. still being in ..[some place]..
Q: At time t equals 1, what's the probability of the molecule still being in the human body?
A: If the probability of being cleared at each step is p, (the answer)it's 1 minus p.(1-p)
> if the probability of being cleared was 0.5 at each time step, the time that it still exists after the first time step
  is 1 minus 0.5. i.e., 0.5

*** i.e. means that is

Q: What's the probability of it still being in the human boday at time t equals 2?
It wasn't cleared at time 1, since it's memoryless(independent), whether or not it's cleared at times 2, is also 1/p.
so it's existing still after two steps is going to be (1-p)**0.5, 1 minus p squared.
We saw that with independent probabilities. And the nice thing about working with exponential distributions is we know that
the probabilities are independent.
exponential[ˌekspəˈnen(t)SH(ə)l]

>> More generally, it's still being in the body at time t is going to be (1-p)^t, 1 minus p to the t.
So now we have a nice closed-form solution (that will give us the probability of each molecule surviving until time t).

>> ... give(s) sb(us) sth...

Let's look at the question of, suppose that at time t=0 (t equals 0), there are m0 molecules.

>> ... be(is) likely to be at ..[time]..
Q: Now we can ask, how many molecules are there likely to be at any time t?
A: Let's write a little program to look at that.

struggle[ˈstrəɡəl]
phrase[frāz]

{decay[dəˈkā]:to decrease usually gradually in size, quantity, activity, or force}.
gradually[ˈɡrajo͞oəlē]: in a gradual way; slowly; by degrees.

>> it never gets there ....
> exponential decay. It drops very quickly in the beginning, and then it asymptotes towards 0. But of course
  it never quite gets there in a continuous model.
> If we had a discrete model, we would eventually have to get to 0, because that last molecule would either
  get cleared or not.
> But in a continuous world, which is in this case, probably not a good model, or not a perfect model I should say,
  because it allows us to have a quarter of a molecule there, which we kind of know is physiologically nonsense,
  biochemically nonsense.

asymptote[ˈasəm(p)ˌtōt]: noun. a line that continually approaches a given curve but does not meet it at any finite
                         distance.
physioloically[ˌfizēəˈläjək(ə)lē]: in a way that relates to the functions of living organisms[ˈôrɡəˌnizəm] and
                                   their parts.
organism[ˈôrɡəˌnizəm]: an individual animal, plant, or single-celled[sel] life form.

You can see we get this exponential decay.
>> But as we saw previously, if we plot an exponential on a log axis, as the math would tell us, we get a straight line.

And that, in fact, is a very simple and nice way to see whether you have an exponential distribution.
>>> Put it on a log axis, see if it's straight.

It's a good trick, and one we use a lot.
So there, I look the physical model I described and derived through a little bit of math, what the result
should be, and implemented some code to give us a plot of what that told us.

derive[dəˈrīv]: obtain something from (a specified source).

>> Let's look at a different way of doing it.
I could have instead written a Monte Carlo simulation to do the same kind of thing.
> So here, instead of working out the probabilities, I just tried to write some code that exactly mimicked the
  physical process that I was talking about.
> So instead of knowing that I could just look at 1 minus p to the t, at each step, I cleared some molecules.

mimic[ˈmimik]: imitate (someone or their actions or words), especially in order to entertain or ridicule.
imitate[ˈiməˌtāt]: take or follow as a model.

>> I did that for each molecule, deciding whether or not it should be cleared.

> Let's look what happens if compare the two results.

Add on Friday afternoon, Dec. 31.
>> Well, much to my relief, I get kind of the same curve.
> Not exactly. You'll notice that the blue curve, the analytical[ˌanəˈlidik(ə)l] model is a beautiful smooth
  curve, whereas the red curve has got a little bit of jaggies.

relief[rəˈlēf]: a feeling of reassurance and relaxation following release from anxiety[aNGˈzīədē] or distress[dəˈstres].
reassurance[ˌrēəˈSHo͝orəns]: the action of removing someone's doubts or fears.
whereas: in contrast or comparison with the fact that.
jaggies[ˈjaɡəd]: having rough, sharp points protruding[prəˈtro͞odiNG].
protruding[prəˈtro͞odiNG]: sticking out; projecting.

> It's clearly very similar to the blue curve, but not identical.
identical: similar in every detail; exactly alike.
>> It doesn't surprise me.

There is some randomness in there. And in fact, I could have gotten unlucky and gotten something that didn't
look like the blue curve. But given the sample size, that would have been quite surprising.

>> Which of ....
Q: Which of these two models do you like better?
We've got one I'll call the analytical model, and one I'll call the simulation model.
> Both sho exponential decay[dəˈkā].
>> That is to
> That is to say the number of molecules declines exponentially, quite quickly.
But they're not quite identical.
Q: Which would we prefer or which would you prefer?
A: There is no right answer for this.
>> There is + no + (adjective) + (singular noun)
Just for fun, I'll ask for a poll.
Q: Who prefers the analytical model?
Q: Who prefer the simulation?

Somebody who prefers(Third-Person singular verb) the analytical, tell me why.
> It looks a lot nicer. That's kind of human nature, to prefer something that looks prettier.
On the other hand, (what we're really interested in) is the question of not aesthetics[esˈTHediks],
but fidelity to the actual physical situation

aesthetics[esˈTHediks]: a set of principles concerned with the nature and appreciation of beauty,
                        especially in art.
fidelity[fəˈdelədē]: faithfulness to a person, cause, or belief, demonstrated by continuing loyalty
                      and support.

A straight line might look even nicer, but it wouldn't be accurate.
So when we think about evaluating a model, what we really should be asking, I think, are two questions.
** One is fidelity
** And another way to think about that is credibility.
