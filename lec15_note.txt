Lecture 15

Q: How many samples are needed to have confidence in result?
A: Fortunately, there is a very solid sef of mathematics that lets us answer this question in a good way.

>> At the root of all of it is the notion of variance.

** Variance is a measure of how mush spread there is in the possible outcomes.

In order to talk about variance, given this definition, we need to have different outcomes(plural), which is why we
always want to run multiple trails rather than do sth(say on trial with many flips).

Q: Why would I do multiple trails adding up to a million rather than 1 trail of a million?
A: The reason is by doing sth(having multiple trails, each of sth(which give me a different outcome), I can then look
at how different (the outcomes of the different trials) are and get a measure of variance.

>>> If I do 10 trails and get 10 wildly different answers, then I probably shouldn't believe any one of those answers,
and I probably shouldn't even think I can average those answers and believe the mean is a real answer because if run
an 11th trial maybe I'll get something totally different yet again.

** “Yet again” has a similar meaning to “once again”. You would say it when something that happens regularly happens.

>> we can formalize this notion of variance in a way that should be familiar to many of you.

the concept of Standard deviation - the fraction of vales close to mean

σ(x) = sqrt(1/abs(x)*Σ(x∈X)*(x-μ)^2), μ = mean

# We can say the standard deviation of x, where x is a set of trails, is equal to the square root of 1 over the
absolute value of (the length of x) the number of trails times the summation of the value of each trial, little x and
big X, of x minus μ(mu) squared, where μ(mu) is the mean.

>> sigma is usually used to talk about that.
>> As I said, that's the {cardinality[ˌkärdəˈnalədē]基数: the number of elements in a set or other grouping, as a
property of that grouping.}of x

Those of you (are majoring in math) are going to love that.

>> But for those of you who are more computationally(adv.) oriented. --> academically oriented.
I recommend you just take a look at teh code.

Now we know what standard deviation means. What are we going to do with it?
We're going to use it to look at the relationship between the number of samples (we've looked
at) and how much confidence we should have in the answer.
